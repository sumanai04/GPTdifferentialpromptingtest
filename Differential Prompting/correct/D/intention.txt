This program is written in Python and it reads a list of integers L.
It then iterates over the list and checks if the elements are equal.
If they are equal, it continues to the next iteration.
If they are not equal, it checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and if the next element is smaller than the current element.
If both conditions are met, it checks if there is already a winning pair of indices (b, e) that satisfy the same conditions.
If there is no winning pair, it sets the winning pair to the current indices (b, e).
If there is already a winning pair, it checks if the current pair is trivial (i.e. if the first element of the pair is 0 and the second element is equal to the length of the list).
If the current pair is trivial, it sets the winning pair to False.
Finally, it checks if the winning pair is not False and prints "YES" if it is True and "NO" if it is False.
